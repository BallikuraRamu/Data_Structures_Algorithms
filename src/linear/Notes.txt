In CSE there are several algorithms 
which is designed to search the elements in array/list.

Mainly focus on Linear and Binary Search algorithms 
are searching the target element in array/list.

Key Differences:
----------------
-> Linear Search is used to find the element in array 
by following sequential and array is not sorted order.

-> Binary Search is used to find the element in array 
by following split the array based on mid value 
then traverse the loop (Left / right) to until find the exact target,
Array required sorting for spliting the havles.

Time Complexity:
---------------- 
 Linear Search >> O(n),    where the n is the size of an array.
 Binary Search >> (log n), where n is size.
